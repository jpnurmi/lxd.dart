/// Status codes
///
/// The LXD REST API often has to return status information, be that the reason
/// for an error, the current state of an operation or the state of the various
/// resources it exports.
///
/// To make it simple to debug, all of those are always doubled. There is a
/// numeric representation of the state which is guaranteed never to change and
/// can be relied on by API clients. Then there is a text version meant to make
/// it easier for people manually using the API to figure out what’s happening.
///
/// In most cases, those will be called `status` and `statusCode`, the former
/// being the user-friendly string representation and the latter the fixed
/// numeric value.
///
/// The codes are always 3 digits, with the following ranges:
///
/// - 100 to 199: resource state (started, stopped, ready, …)
/// - 200 to 399: positive action result
/// - 400 to 599: negative action result
/// - 600 to 999: future use
class LxdStatusCode {
